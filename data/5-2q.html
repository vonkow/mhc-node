<ul style="text-align:left;"><li><strong>Counselor Kents</strong> recently completed training on a treatment that was designed for the patient&#39;s problem. Kents says that the best counselors recommend this treatment. Kents explains the method and tells the patient that it will probably work for the patient. Kents also tells the patient about other methods that may work. The patient is asked if they have any questions. The patient does not have questions, and Kents ask them if they want to accept the recommended treatment. Feeling that Kents knows best, the patient prepares to undergo the treatment.</li></ul>
