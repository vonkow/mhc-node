<ul style="text-align:left;"><li><strong>Counselor Young</strong> offers a treatment that best suits the needs of the patient. Young explains all aspects of the treatment and describes at length the pros and cons of alternatives, including doing nothing. Young seeks to understand the patients needs and concerns, and asks many questions in order to gain the patient’s perspective and understanding. Young does not push the patient to accept any treatment but rather encourages the patient to make a choice that makes them feel comfortable. The patient considers this. Feeling that Young knows best, the patient decides to undergo the treatment.</li></ul>
