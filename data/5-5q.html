<ul style="text-align:left;"><li><strong>Counselor Heath</strong> offers a treatment which performs relatively better than others. Heath relates the effects and side-effects of each treatment including taking no action. Then Heath asks the Patient questions about the treatments making sure the Patient understands. Heath asks if the Patient feels comfortable making a decision with the present information. Since the Patient is satisfied, Heath asks the Patient to think carefully before choosing a treatment. Heath asks the Patient to think about what they have both said about the alternatives and then think about choosing. Feeling that Heath knows best, Heath&#39;s Patient prepares to undergo the treatment.</li></ul>
